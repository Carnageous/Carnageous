### Hi there, I'm Janis ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack developer working at [@Dive solutions](https://dive-solutions.de), where I work on an awesome cloud-native CAE tool. Previously at [@SMS Digital](https://github.com/smsdigital) building next-generation tools for manufacturing.
I enjoy to see the web evolve since 2012 and have found my true passion in complex and next-gen webapps.
Let me throw some buzzwords at you so you get an idea of my work:

- Vue, React and the latest stuff.
- Typescript!
- Python, Go
- Webassembly :heart:
