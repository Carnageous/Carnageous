### Hi there, I'm Janis ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack developer working at [@SMS Digital](https://github.com/smsdigital), currently developing "[the learning steel plant](https://www.sms-digital.com/solutions/product-categories/predictive-product-quality)" in Angular and Python.
I enjoy to see the web evolve since 2012 and have found my true passion in complex and next-gen webapps.
Let me throw some buzzwords at you so you get an idea of my work:

- Angular, Vue
- Typescript!
- Python, Go, C++
- Webassembly :heart:
